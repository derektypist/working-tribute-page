# Derek Dhammaloka Tribute Page (Working Version)

Welcome to my tribute page.  The purpose of this project is to provide a tribute page of myself.  It is a working version of [Tribute Page](https://derektypist.github.io/tribute-page).

## UX

The tribute page provides my name, slogan, image (including caption) and information.

The tribute page consists of year and milestone (e.g. Passed driving test at Sidcup, Kent).  The year is an integer (e.g. 1994) and the milestone is a string (e.g. Passed driving test at Sidcup, Kent).  Organising principle is timeline.
